                  <p>Lawrie is a business and technology leader with over thirty years of multi-disciplinary industry experience.</p>
<p>From his early days as a FORTRAN programmer integrating with SCADA systems, building real-time fault-tolerant Tandem COBOL trading applications, to today - where he holds an executive position in the hottest new cloud-native platform start-up - he has been at the forefront of technology with a passion for delivering customer value.</p>
<p>During his fifteen years at Microsoft, Lawrie held deep technology delivery roles, engagement management and solution sales positions. His focus was working with early-adopter customers - through the evolution of client-server, multi-tier, distributed architecture, portal and integration platforms and eventually cloud computing.</p>
<p>His approach with customers includes strategic planning with purpose, critical thinking for risk-balanced innovation, communication and collaboration for effectiveness, impact and influence for results, virtual team leadership for effective enablement, and an outcomes oriented mindset for investment value.</p>
<p>Lawrie changed gears six years ago and sought new challenges in the local startup community. Most recently with Mojio - the leading connected car company - he was responsible for the commercial launch of a new category of product across two continents with enterprise customers, and managed world-wide business development activities.</p>
<p>Lawrie holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Computing Science, from The University of the West of Scotland.</p>
<p>When away from his computer, Lawrie spends the winter months snowshoeing and snowboarding, and the summer months boating and hiking.</p>
